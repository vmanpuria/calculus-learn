1 / (1 + e ^ (-x)) -> Logistic function -> sigmoid function -> output between 0 and 1.

limit should be finite from both left and right for a limit to be defined

the logistic function is often used in mathematical modeling, including in the field of population dynamics. The logistic function is characterized by an S-shaped curve and is commonly employed to describe processes where growth is initially exponential but slows down as it approaches a limiting value. This is particularly relevant in situations where resources become a limiting factor.

slope = tan <theta> = differential = rate of change

Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are used to reduce dimensions while retaining important information.

RELU functions (infinity to infinity) replaced in hidden layers (good step function) to make neural network faster.

Sigmoid give between 0 and 1 (good for classification) in the output layer of neural networks
